# EnergyPredML
Develop a machine learning model that predicts the energy consumption of a specific chemical process based on input variables (e.g., flow rates, temperatures, pressures, chemical concentrations)

#Overview

This project aims to develop a machine learning model to predict the energy consumption of a specific chemical process. The model will help optimize energy usage and improve the efficiency of the process by providing accurate predictions of energy demand based on various input parameters.

The project uses historical process data and machine learning algorithms to predict energy consumption in real-time.
